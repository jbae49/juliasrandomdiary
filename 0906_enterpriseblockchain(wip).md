Nightfall enables private transactions on ethereum using zk-SNARKs


- people to transact privately/securely on private blockchain 
- powerful network effect 
- On ethereum which is amazing 
- Why you chose ethereum 
  - “Adoption”-> scalable?
  - Crypto ecosystem is moving towards building on public chain with the edge for everyone
  - Easy to migrate 
  - Enterprise blockchains are private blockchains in order to get scale and connectivity 
  - Numbers tell money will be moving 
- 20 zk transactions (slow and expensive?) 
  - Private blockchains are expensive per transaction
  - Batch transactions up together // batching tool // 20 tx in a batch and 24 cents of transaction 6-7 cents gosh darn scale 
  - Public mannet with full privacy 
- Why ZK?
  - It was the most robust level of privacy 
  - We not only wanna do fungible things but also 
  - Unique assets// non fungible throw those in a typical mixer 
- Code auditing 
  - Audit all transactions?

  - Who wants to use blockchain 
    - Show me a very specific value proposition and very specific deals // microsoft / software life cycle asset management / food trace // 
Cheaper
  - Diplomas or educational certs which are better on the public blockchain // enterprise exex coordinates with other busines partners and wnat 
  - No enterprise data at all on chain 
  - Hashes and links and proofs that transaction happened 
  - Private swarm → 
  - Private key management // getting hacked //worst case scenario // enterprises are so conservative 


No control 


- Zk proof to transact privately to transact 

Ethereum 

- What specific use cases?
  - Enterprise users // how do i as an enterprise transact with other companies

- Most valuable information going through centralized entity wary of 
- Private blockchain / enormous on boarding process
