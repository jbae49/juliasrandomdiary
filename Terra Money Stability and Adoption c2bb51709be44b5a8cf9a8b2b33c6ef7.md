### **HOLY 🐮!**

It was the day after I saw that the LFG acquired another 37,863 BTC ($1.5 bn) to continuously support the peg stability of Terra’s stablecoin. UST.

Over the past 7 days, market volatility across crypto assets has been significant.

Let’s just first talk about what a **deflationary token** is.

The concept of deflation in traditional finance with the concept of deflation in crypto is very different. Put simply, **cryptos with a finite supply are deflationary**. With deflationary cryptos, the supply of coins will decrease over time (for UST, by burning* LUNA) instead of increasing ****which doesn’t necessarily mean the value of that specific crypto will rise. It will if the demand remains consistent. 

> *“Burning” crypto means intentionally sending the tokens to a wallet where they can’t be retrieved; permanently removing from circulation*
> 

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

- $LUNA and $UST (TerraUSD) are two native tokens of the Terra network.
- $UST is a stablecoin that is designed to be pegged 1:1 to USD.
- $LUNA serves as the protocol’s the governance token so Luna’s holders are granted governance rights and voting power for the protocol.
- Instead of being backed by dollar reserves in a bank account as other centralized stablecoins (i.e. USDT, USDC, etc) do, UST is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin.
- Smart contracts keep the price of UST to $1 by burning LUNA tokens to mint new UST tokens.

**TOKENOMICS**

- To create more UST tokens, we have to burn $LUNA.
- In the Terra ecosystem, **users can always swap the LUNA for UST**, and vice versa, **at $1 regardless of the market price of either token at the time**
    - A week ago, $LUNA was around at $80 and people were able to redeem it for 80 UST tokens whatever the price of $UST at that time.
- So, it’s stabilizing mechanism all has to do with **arbitrage**.
    - If demand for UST rises and $UST > $1
        
        → LUNA holders can swap 1 LUNA for example at $80 to create 80 UST tokens which is worth more than $80
        
        → To do so, by increasing the supply of Terra, it can bring the price back down to $1
        
        → During this swapping process, a portion of LUNA is burned and the remaining portion goes to the Terra ecosystem’s community treasury.
        
    - If demand is low and $UST < $1
        
        → UST holders can exchange their $UST, still 80 UST tokens (which is worth less than $80) for $80 of $LUNA
