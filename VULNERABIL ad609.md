# VULNERABILITIES

4/3/2022

I stumbled across a blog post that says it is actually possible for anyone to recover Uniswap liquidity tokens that are accidentally sent to the pair contract itself by calling the `burn` function. I stopped reading the blog and looked at the `burn` function (UniswapV2Pair.sol). As I’m new to Solidity and there was an unfamiliar modifier called `lock`. I was curious why this is needed in many of their external functions as it’s just seemed to be used as it looks; checks whether the `unlocked` variable equals 1 and then changes it to 0 and then changes it again to 1 after executing the function. The answer was a simple preventative technique against reentrancy attacks.

Reentrancy is one of the most well-known vulnerabilities in Solidity-based Ethereum smart contracts. A famous exploitation case of reentrancy is the DAO attack; 3.6M Ether was stolen.

Reentrancy can simply be done like the above. 4 simple steps

1. The attacker 🙂 initiates a transaction by calling the withdraw function (`attack()` here)
2. Contract A checks whether the balance of contract B is greater than 0 and as there is no `payable` function in contract B that in general receives Ether, the `fallback()` function is called
3. The fallback function recursively calls the `withdraw()` function again.
4. Repeated until the fund stored in contract A is completely drained then finally can break out of that loop

How can we prevent our contract from Reentrancy attacks?

- Update state variables before making any external calls to other contracts
    
    → In the above example, you can update the balance (`balance = 0`) before you make a call to another contract (`send Ether`) then once the fallback function is called, as the balance is already updated to 0, so the withdraw function can not be called again.
    
- Use a modifier called **ReentrancyGuard** that can prevent reentrancy during certain functions
    
    → the `lock` modifier above 
    

Curiosity solved 😊
