I'm assisting Professor Chandler's cryptocurrency course as a TA and going to have a presentation during our security week and this will be the script for that presentation.
Fall semester has started and I've been very busy. Yesterday, I had a call with a crypto vc firm as they reached out to me saying they're interested in putting our eth seoul hack project to their acceleration program. 
The deal would be 100K $ in cash for 3 months. Still not sure whether we're gonna take it + going to reach out some other accelerators as well. Also want to mention that
I'm so in love. I think it's love. Have never felt this way to anybody but him. He inspires me, motivates me without saying a word but just observing how he is responsible for his work and everything he cares about makes me 
study and work harder. 


The topics I want to go over are:

* common defi hack patterns including reentrancy, oracle manipulation, flashloan attacks by exploring a bit detail how the hack worked. 


or it can be 

* there is a trilemma in blockchain. comparing protocols by each component, discuss about their security.
