I had little knowledge of ZKPs, still little. 


Here is the conversation with my dear friend from yesterday (Sep 6th) 

S: What's ZK?

J: You can prove that you know the answer without revealing your answer

S: WTF are you talking about, how? 

J: Let’s say I know the answer to a certain question. And you indirectly ask another well-designed question that if I know the answer of that other question, then with a very high chance, I know the answer of the original question; which I’m talking about is non-interactive ZK, and you keep asking me a bunch of other questions and if I keep answering correctly about those questions then I likely know the answer of the original question which I’m talking about is interactive ZK

S: I know what you’re saying but can’t get it yet



Sadly that was all I knew about ZK. So I read a couple more writings to understand a bit more about ZK…
