I went to the edm party last night ðŸŽ§. I had gummies and sober and had fun (afair) thanks to that I slept A LOT today.Â I went with my neighbor and he drove me home so luckily I was able to come back home safely. Heâ€™s a phd student studying pharmaceutical science and he loves drugs. Hmm I think Iâ€™m feeling really lonely these days
