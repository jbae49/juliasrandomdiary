I just moved into this apartment (in the middle of nowhere) this January and met my neighbor a few weeks ago. I hung out with him several times and last Saturday we were drinking and playing video games like Mario Kart and Super Smash, having a fun 
and he suddenly told me that he had a thing for Asian girls and esp for Asian girls with glasses. WTF does that even MEAN? As I'm a straight Asian girl or women so ugh that was kinda embarrassing
Idk I'm getting my period or sth UGH NM! So... this week I want to know more about

- NFT (how to launch ~ its vulnerabilities) & NFT marketplaces
- C-corp & Stock Vesting
