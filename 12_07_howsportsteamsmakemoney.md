**Americans love sports!**

The big four professional leagues in the United States are NFL (National Football League), NBA (National Basketball Association), MLB (Major League Baseball), and NHL (National Hockey League). Have you ever been curious about how these leagues make money? I mean not only ticket sales. Some of the highest-paid players make $50 million+ yearly. Leagues also hire the best coaches and nutritionists, sometimes spend hundreds of millions of dollars renovating their arena and practice facility, and so on. How can they afford all of these? It’s pretty simple. Think about what people do. They watch the games on live TV, commute to the games, drink beer and hotdogs, buy merch (merchandise), and so on. That’s pretty much it. Respectively, the league earns money: from the media rights, parking lots, concessions, and merchandise, and you already know that there are sponsorships like advertisements all over the arena and licensing deals like Nike and AIA Group (below image) logos in players’ uniforms.
