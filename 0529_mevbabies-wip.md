### What is MEV? 

Blockchains like Ethereum while in most regards they are very decentralized, the ordering of transactions within a single block is actually completely in the hands of a single minor. They can insert their own transactions, rearrange those of users to maximize their profits by choosing transactions with higher gas fees or even censor them completely. MEV describes how much value minors can extract from users and other minors by using these powers to their advantage.

<br />

There was a lift-off in amount of extracted value during and after DeFi Summer (summer in 2020), and it came with some negative externalities like gas fees going way higher and a lot of chain congestion (i.e. blockspace usage) which led a lot of reverted transactions to land on chain. **Flashbots** provide a way to communicate transactions directly to the minors by sending them an array of transactions that are included atomically

### MEV strats

- arbitrage
    
    ex) Uniswap price arbitrage trades â†’ timing matters here! For miners, they can just put their transactions to capitalize on these arb opportunities or get profits by overpaid gas fees paid by other traders or bots
    
- sandwiching
    
    just like frontrunning in traditional finance; by observing the mempool, miners can put their transactions before and right after a certain HUGE transaction that will influence the price of the underlying asset substantially
    
- liquidation
    
    ex) dydx liquidation
    
- JIT (Just-in-Time Liquidity)*
    
    : a new form of MEV that uses Uniswap v3's concentrated liquidity
    
    ```jsx
    Here's what that looks like in practice! @bertcmiller
    
    tx 1: add liquidity on v3 ETH/USDC pair
    tx 2: part of this transaction trades on the v3 ETH/USDC pair
    tx 3: remove liquidity on v3 ETH/USDC pair
    ```
    
- time bandit attacks - Ari*
    
    - One miner observes recent huge arbitrage opportunities likely taken by bots and already been recorded on chain. What miners can do here is that the miner rewinds the blockchain and then forks it in a 51% attack, which means it can retroactively take that past juicy transactions in its forked chain, and use the profit by taking these arbitrage opportunities to subsidize the 51% attack. Usually 51% attackers just harvest the block rewards but in this case, the miner can harvest much more, taking value in the application layer not just in the consensus layer. These attacks destabilize the whole blockchain and potentially put a system like Ethereum at risk.

    - Uncle blocks are created when two blocks are mined and broadcasted at the same time (with the same block number). Since only one of the blocks can enter the primary Ethereum chain, the block that gets validated across more nodes becomes the canonical block, and the other one becomes what is known as an uncle block. Uncle blocks are recorded and accessible from the chain, but they have no impact on the canonical chain and their transactions do not change any state. Unlike Bitcoin, in the Ethereum system, miners still receive a block reward for discovering the uncle block; so basically, pseudo-mempool
    
    Examples in practice
    
    - uncle banditâ€™d Sandwich bot - [bercmiller](https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339)
        
        ```jsx
        How it happened.
        
        1. Searchers observed a large Uniswap transaction in the mempool 
        2. decided to arbitrage
        3. created a bundle looked like
        	- Searcher buys AMP using WETH from the WETH/AMP Uniswap pool (driving up the price of AMP)
        	- Random Uniswap user buys AMP using WETH from the WETH/AMP Uniswap pool (further driving up the price of AMP)
        	- Searcher sells AMP to the WETH/AMP Uniswap pool (at a much higher price than they bought it for)
        # Here, transactions in searchers' bundle should be executed in the exact order
        # And, a bundle should never be split up, the whole bundle is included to a new block or nothing is
        4. Unluckily, the miner ended up mining an uncle block, which means
        5. transactions in the bundle are now public (Flashbots bundles that include searchers' transactions ought to be directly included in a block without being exposed in the mempool where everyone can see)
        6. A thrid actor, who we're calling "the Uncle" saw this bundle
        7. and created a new bundle like below
        	- from the uncle block: Searcher buys AMP using WETH from the WETH/AMP Uniswap pool (driving up the price of AMP)
        	- Uncle Bandit buys AMP from Sushi Pool (where the price was not affected)
        	- Uncle Bandit sells AMP in Uniswap pool (at a much higher price than they bought it for)
        ```

        ```jsx
        How it happened. 
        1. Tokensnipers were waiting for new tokens on Uniswap
        ```
