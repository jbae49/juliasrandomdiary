# Ronin bridge hack

Apr 9th 2022 

<br />
<br />

üîµ **Key Points** 

- validator nodes were compromised
- the attacker hacked 5 validator private keys
- as some validator nodes were stuck and not performed properly, they had to set the threshold only to 5 out of 9

<br />
<br />

üîµ **On-going process** 

- the hacker moved some part of their ether to [tornado.cash](http://tornado.cash) lol
- their team is now expanding their validator nodes to other organizations to be more decentralized, including Animoca Brands, Nansen, Delphi Digital. Their goal is to set up to 21 nodes, which are 12 more nodes than when it was hacked.
- and they are evolving their source code to improve their security and decentralization

*Curious* 

- *why anyone can‚Äôt be the validator in the Ronin chain ‚Üí actually can! check out below ü§ó*
- *hack back the hacker?*
- *defi is really a dark forest?*
- *a bridge is a cross-chain?*
- *and what‚Äôs multi-chains*

<br />
<br />

**What is Ronin bridge?**

---

- is like a vault; bridges like Ronin's typically work by¬†**locking up cryptocurrency in smart contracts on one chain, and then re-issuing those tokens in ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù form on a destination chain**
- Ronin chain is a sidechain, *or parallel network,* to Ethereum. Ronin is created in 2020 after realizing Ethereum‚Äôs base layer was too slow and expensive to handle all the transactions required to power such a game.

<br />
<br />

**What is and why we need a Blockchain Bridge?** 

---

- enable you to swap/transfer tokens/coins from one chain/network to another
    - so that you can interact with another chain‚Äôs dApps
    - for ex, you would switch your native Ethereum on the Ethereum network to Polygon network because of its (MUCH) cheaper transaction fee and you can only get 0.5% interest for your ether on the Ethereum, but can get 3% on Polygon
    - if you were to use the Ronin Bridge to move ether (ETH) from Ethereum to Ronin, ETH would get locked up on Ethereum to serve as 1:1 backing for wrapped ether (WETH) issued on Ronin

<br />
<br />

üê∏ - all **coins** have their own blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc); **tokens** are also cryptocurrencies living on another blockchain that can broaden that blockchain network‚Äôs utility by being used in a variety of applications

<br />
<br />

üî∑ *‚ÄúThe fundamental security limits of bridges are actually a key reason why, while I am optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem ‚Ä¶ I am pessimistic about cross-chain applications,‚Äù Buterin wrote. Sending assets across cross-chain bridges will never carry the same security guarantees as transacting within individual blockchain ecosystems, because they are particularly vulnerable to 51% attacks, Buterin further explained*
